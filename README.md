### About Me:
I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer based in California

- :zap: On my free time I try to get some leetcode in, learn new languages or frameworks/libraries. When I am not coding I like to spend my time going to the gym working out, playing basketball. Sometimes I like to stay in and binge animes on Netflix or play video games.
